        <h4>Many wonderful yarn companies and dyers offered their wholehearted support of this project! For the Heart On My Sleeve sweaters we used a wide range of yarns and fibres, all in a DK weight.</h4>
        <p>We really loved the yarns we worked with, but we also encourage you to support yarn producers and dyers local to you. Because the yarns used in these designs are all DK weight, and all the patterns are designed for the same gauge, you can use your favourite DK weight yarn for any of the designs in the ebook. If you are uncertain, take <a ui-sref="knits">your copy of the ebook</a> when you visit your local yarn shop and the staff can help you choose the right yarn for your sweater.</p>
        <p>Thanks again to the supportive businesses who provided yarn for this project, and prizes for <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/discuss/tin-can-knits/3579208" title="Heart On My Sleeve KAL" target="new">the knitalong</a>.</p>
