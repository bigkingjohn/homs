            <h4>Imagine nine of your favourite knit designers worked together to create a collection of simple and satisfying yoke sweaters.</h4>
            <p>Well we have done just that! The Heart On My Sleeve ebook will be available to purchase for one year, and all proceeds will be donated to the Against Malaria Foundation. <a href="http://heartonmysleeveknits.com/againstmalaria.html" target="_parent">Full details on the fundraising specifics here</a>.</p>
            <p>As knit designers, we are constantly inspired and impressed by the knitting community. Our work goes out into the world and passes through so many hands, and in this we saw an opportunity to contribute. Heart On My Sleeve invites people to knit together for an excellent cause: the Against Malaria Foundation.</p>

                    <p><em><strong>Malaria is preventable; no one need die of it.</strong></em> </p>
                    <p>Yet 400 million people fall ill every year, half a million die of the disease, and 70% of those who die are kids under 5. As parents, Alexa and I know that there is nothing we wouldn't do to protect our children. Raising funds for AMF is a way we can reach out and make a difference in people's lives. <a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/Faq_malaria.aspx" target="new">Learn more about malaria here</a>.</p>
