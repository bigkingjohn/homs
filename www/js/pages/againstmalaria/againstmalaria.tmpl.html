        <h4>Choosing how to give can be daunting.  Looking at the needs in the world around us can leave us feeling numb and confused about how to contribute in a way that will genuinely help.</h4>
        <p>As parents, Alexa and I know that there is almost nothing we wouldn’t do to protect our children. While I was pregnant with my second baby, learning the devastating statistics about malaria made me feel like my heart would break.</p>

            <p>Malaria is a preventable disease - no one need die of it. Yet thousands of small children and pregnant women die of it every day. Malaria is also relatively cheap to prevent, so every ebook we sell and every dollar you donate really counts toward protecting people and improving economies.</p>
            <p>The Against Malaria Foundation puts 100% of public donations toward the purchase of nets, and tracks the entire process, so you can see where your money has helped. </p>

        <p>For every $18 ebook sold, we pay $0.97 USD in PayPal fees, and  approximately $0.18 USD in Ravelry fees<em> (will vary slightly)</em>. So $16.80 per ebook will be donated the Against Malaria  Foundation. Funds will be transferred on a weekly basis over the period  that the ebook is for sale <em>(ending February 28, 2018)</em>, and each transfer  will be listed on our Against Malaria fund-raising page <a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/heartonmysleeveknits" target="new">here</a>.</p>
        <p>We aim to make this project fun, full of hope, and accessible to all. If the $18 purchase price is beyond your budget, we'd still love you to participate, so please simply send us an email at <a href="mailto:heartonmysleeveknits@gmail.com">heartonmysleeveknits@gmail.com</a>.</p>
        <p>Conversely, if our contribution has inspired to give more, please <a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/heartonmysleeveknits" target="new">click here right now and donate what you can</a>.</p>

        <h3>Facts about Malaria</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Malaria is preventable - no one need die.</li>
            <li>Currently, malaria kills half a million people every year and 300-600 million fall ill. Before bed nets were made available, it was three or more times that.</li>
            <li>70% of the deaths are children under 5. Put another way, 7 jumbo jets full of children disappear because of malaria every day.</li>
            <li>Malaria is the world’s single largest killer of pregnant women.</li>
            <li>90% of the deaths are in sub-Saharan Africa.</li>
            <li>Malaria is relatively cheap to prevent: nets are the best prevention, and they cost $2.50 USD each. Every 100-1,000 nets distributed and installed equals 1 life saved.</li>
        </ul>
