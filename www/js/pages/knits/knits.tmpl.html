        <h4>Nine knit designers have come together to create this project and share it with you. We each started with a basic sleeve and body pattern, then designed a unique yoke for your knitting pleasure!</h4>
        <p>Pick your favourite, or make a few; each design is sized from baby to big for sweaters for the whole family.</p>
        <p>What is the same about these designs? They are all knit from the bottom up <em>(you start with sleeves, then knit the body, then join it all to work the yoke)</em>. They are all worked in DK weight yarn, at the same gauge; so you can use your favourite DK weight yarn for any of the designs.</p>
        <p>And as you can see, each design is sized from baby to big; so you can knit for grandbaby or for grandma!</p>
