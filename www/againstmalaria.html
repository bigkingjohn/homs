        <h4>Choosing how to give can be daunting. </h4>
        <h4>Looking at the needs in the world around us leaves us feeling uncertain and often confused about how to contribute in a way that will actually help. And there are so many important and worthy causes and projects.</h4>
        <p><a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com" target="new"><img src="images/logo_AMF.gif" alt="" width="94" height="115" class="biopic"/></a>We chose to donate to the <a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com" title="Against Malaria Foundation" target="new">Against Malaria Foundation</a> because the need spoke to us personally as mothers. Malaria is a preventable disease - no one need die of it. Yet thousands of small children and pregnant women die every day. Malaria is also cheap to prevent, which means that every ebook sold and every dollar you donate really counts toward saving lives and improving economies. Since bednets have been made available, the number of malaria deaths have been reduced greatly; so by donating to AMF we are contributing to an intervention which is proven to be effective.</p>
        <p>The Against Malaria Foundation puts 100% of donations toward the purchase and distribution of nets, and tracks the entire process, so you can see where your money has helped. The Foundation’s operating costs are covered by separate donations from businesses, so you know your dollars are going directly to help families in need, not to pay salaries or administration. For more information on the Against Malaria Foundation you can visit their website at <a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com" title="Against Malaria Foundation" target="new">www.againstmalaria.com</a>.</p>
        <p>For every $18 ebook sold, we pay $0.97 USD in PayPal fees, and  approximately $0.18 USD in Ravelry fees (will vary slightly). So for  each ebook sold, approximately $16.80 will go to the Against Malaria  Foundation. Funds will be transferred on a weekly basis over the period  that the ebook is for sale (ending February 28, 2018), and each transfer  will be listed on our Against Malaria fund-raising page here:  <a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/heartonmysleeveknits" target="new">https://www.againstmalaria.com/heartonmysleeveknits</a></p>
        <p>We aim to make this fundraiser FUN and full of hope, and accessible to all. If the $18 purchase price is beyond your budget, we'd still love you to participate, so please simply send us an email at <a href="mailto:heartonmysleeveknits@gmail.com">heartonmysleeveknits@gmail.com</a>. </p>
        <p>Conversely, if this project has inspired to give more, please <a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/heartonmysleeveknits">click through right now and donate what you can</a> to this excellent cause.</p>

        <h3>	Facts about Malaria        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>At least a million people die from malaria each year. Some put the estimates as high as 2.7 million.</li>
          <li>Malaria is preventable - no one need die!</li>
          <li>It is relatively cheap to prevent: bednets are the best prevention, and they cost $2.50 USD each.</li>
          <li>Malaria kills half a million people every year and 400 million fall ill, and before bed nets were made available, it was three or more times that.</li>
          <li>70% of the deaths are children under 5.</li>
          <li>Malaria is the world’s single largest killer of pregnant women.</li>
          <li>90% of the deaths are in sub-Saharan Africa.</li>
          <li>Every 50-250 nets distributed and installed equals 1 life saved.</li>
